## Hardware

### Raspberry Pi

### Micro SD Card

### Power supply

### Optional hardware

- USB power pack
- HDMI cable
- monitor
- keyboard


## Software

The software required for the workshop should be packaged and downloadable from the CarpentriesOffline repository as an image that can be written to the micro SD card. That means that apart from the image, you won't have to download and install any software for the CarpentriesOffline server. However, we will discuss the software that we will be using in a little more detail to give a better understanding of how everything works together.

### Raspberry Pi Operating System

### Access Point

### Python
