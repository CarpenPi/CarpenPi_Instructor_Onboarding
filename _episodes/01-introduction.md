When delivering a software, data or library Carpentry workshop we, usually, are used to have Internet connectivity. Connectivity allows us to download the required data and access lesson materials as well as downloading any software that might be required for a workshop.

However, what if we find ourselves in an area where there is limited or no Internet access or perhaps where access is still very expensive?
