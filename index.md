  This is a setup manual for instructors delivering Carpentry workshops using <a href="https://github.com/CarpentriesOffline">CarpentriesOffline</a>. 
  It is aimed at anyone interested in delivering software workshops in Low-to-Middle-Income Countries. 
  In particular, those who are delivering training in locations without reliable external internet access. 

  These instructions contain information on setting up a raspberry pi network containing the infrastructure and material needed to deliver a workshop without access to the internet. 
</p>

<p>
   Currently it is based on training material from the <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.lc_site }}">Library</a>, and <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentries</a> but can be adapted to deliver any type of workshop.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Although this onboarding is aimed at certified Carpentry instructors it would benefit anybody that will be involved in the delivery of CarpenPi type workshops. It would thus be beneficial to have experience in hosting, organising, instructing or helping with workshops.
