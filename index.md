  This is a setup manual for instructors delivering Carpentry workshops using <a href="https://github.com/CarpenPi">CarpenPi</a>. 
  It is aimed at anyone interested in delivering software workshops in Low-to-Middle-Income Countries. 
  In particular, those who are delivering training in locations without reliable external internet access. 

  These instructions contain information on setting up a raspberry pi network containing the infrastructure and material needed to deliver a workshop without access to the internet. 
</p>

<p>
   Currently it is based on training material from the <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.lc_site }}">Library</a>, and <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentries</a> but can be adapted to deliver any type of workshop.
